# San Andreas Unity

We're porting [GTA: San Andreas](http://www.rockstargames.com/sanandreas/) to Unity!

This won't be a complete re-implementation of the game, but we're hoping to build something similar to [Multi Theft Auto](http://www.mtasa.com/) with assets streamed from an existing installation of San Andreas.

## Setup Instructions

Before starting the game, you need to set path to gta installation (you will be asked for path when project is opened).

Also, after building binary, you need to copy 'Data' folder to 'game_name'_Data folder. The script which should do that, doesn't work right now.

**Note:** It seems that it has been fixed, but it must be reviewed.

## In-game controls

Press Escape while in game to open pause menu. You'll see there a lot of utilities, and among them, there is a window which shows all controls.

Or check [this](/Infos/Controls.md)...

## TODO List

Here is an extensive list of [what should be implemented](/Infos/WhatShouldBeImplemented.md).

Can help us to develop this? In that case, join us on discord so we can discuss about it.
