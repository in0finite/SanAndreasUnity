San Andreas Unity is an open source recreation of GTA San Andreas in Unity.

This won't be a complete recreation, but the focus is on gameplay features, mutliplayer, and creating a framework which will allow easy game extending and unlimited modding possibilities.

For more information about the project, read this [wiki page](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/wiki/About-project).

When running for the first time, the game will ask you for path to GTA installation. You need to own GTA in order to play it.


## Download

Download it for [Windows](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/releases/download/v3.0/SanAndreasUnity-3.0-windows.zip), [Android](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/wiki/Running-on-Android) or [Linux server](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/releases/download/v3.0/SanAndreasUnity-3.0-linuxserver.zip).

The game is tested on [Linux](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/wiki/Running-on-Linux), Windows, Mac, Android and [PS Vita](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/wiki/Building-for-PS-Vita). It supports both Mono and IL2CPP scripting backends, so it can be built for any platform that Unity supports, provided that you can copy PC version of GTASA to target device.
