# San Andreas Unity

We're porting [GTA: San Andreas](http://www.rockstargames.com/sanandreas/) to Unity!

This won't be a complete re-implementation of the game, but we're hoping to build something similar to [Multi Theft Auto](http://www.mtasa.com/) with assets streamed from an existing installation of San Andreas.

## Setup Instructions

- open the project
- open main scene located at Assets/Scenes/Main.unity
- press Play button

When running for the first time, the game will ask you for path to GTA installation, and will store that path in config.user.json. If you ever need to change the path, you can just edit this file.


## In-game controls

Press Escape while in game to open pause menu. You'll see there a lot of utilities, and among them, there is a window which shows all controls.

## TODO List

Here is an extensive list of [what should be implemented](/Docs/TODO.md).

Can help us to develop this? In that case, join us on discord so we can discuss about it.
